# CRYLINE BOTNET
It's a simple rebuild of MIRAI botnet. I rewrote [MIRAI botnet original source code](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code) and delete useless functions (For example: GRE flood). 
Also i fixed any bugs of botnet agent and C&C panel and create new bash scripts to automate the building process.
